# n-islands
I made this to simulate a stochastic process. You can choose how many "islands", the number of colors and the iterations that are made. At every iteration a random island is chosen, then the color of the island to one of its neighbours at random. After a lot of iterations color regions start appearing, it's visually satisfying! Also one of the simulations is an infinite step-by-step graphical process.
